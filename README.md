Crop images taken down a microscope to a circle using Hough Circle implemented by the `CV2` package.

# Usage
Run `crop_circle_gui.py`, which should bring up a GUI.

The cropped image, which is displayed as the output, may not always be accurate - it may be necessary to change the parameters. The method may also fail for certain types of images.
